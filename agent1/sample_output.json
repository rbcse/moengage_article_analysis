      "suggestions": [
        "Replace code blocks with conceptual explanations (e.g., 'Track purchases with product details like price and category' instead of JavaScript examples)",
        "Add a marketer-friendly summary at the top explaining how event tracking enables personalized campaigns and user segmentation",
        "Convert warning/info boxes to plain language (e.g., 'Important: Avoid special characters in event names' instead of markdown formatting)",
        "Simplify technical terms - 'MoEProperties' → 'Event Metadata', 'Non-interactive events' → 'Background Activity Events'",
        "Add real-world examples of how tracked events translate to marketing use cases (e.g., abandoned carts → retargeting emails)",
        "Break SDK version requirements into a separate technical sidebar",
        "Include a visual flowchart showing how event data flows to marketing campaigns",
        "Add a 'Why This Matters' section explaining how event tracking impacts ROI/Customer LTV",
